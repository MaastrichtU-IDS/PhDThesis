# PhD Thesis Managing and Writing
This repository is for sharing resources and tips for PhD thesis managing and writing. Our focus group is UM (FSE/DACS/IDS) PhD students. Jordi Heijman and myself (Chang Sun) hosted a PhD Thesis Writing Workshop session in DACS research day in May 2023. The resources and suggestions we presented and collected in the workshop may be helpful for other and future PhD students. Therefore, we would like to share the slides, resources, and templates in this repository and will keep them updated. 

### Regulation and Process
1. Important to read carefully about the [**New UM Doctoral Regulations**](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/file/doctoralregulations2023includingannexespdf) (Entry into force: 01/Feb/2023)
    - We discussed several important changes in the new regulation in our workshop (Please check the slides in Topic 1). 
2. [UM PhD office](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/phd-office) provides clear steps for you and your supervisors to organize the defense. Contact them immidiately when your thesis gets approved by the assessment committee. 

### Managing your Thesis and Defense
1. **Make a thesis outline** and discuss with your supervisors at the beginning of 4th year (latest). You can find my template on [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mFYP3QIT8QrHebkTPLHVqSpdMrPE0yKA_Mdf6mSJdyo/edit?usp=sharing) or [local Word document](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/PhDThesis/blob/main/Thesis%20Outline%20Template%20%5BChang%20May%202023%5D.docx) as you like. 
    - This outline is like a mini-version of your thesis including the titles, status, key content of your each chapter. This outline will give you and your supervisor a clear overview and a storyline about your thesis and what stage of each chapter and a realitic timeline. You can adapt the outline to your own case. 

2. UM has an [official Overleaf account](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/maastrichtuniversity). You can find the [PhD Thesis Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/maastricht-thesis-template-mtt-v2/sxsnqtrcjjpj) there. 
    - You can make some minor adaption to your own thesis such as listing references for each chatper instead of having a huge Reference section at the end of your thesis. I (Chang) would like to share my [adopted template](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/PhDThesis/tree/main/Chang_Adapted_Overleaf_Template) so that future PhD students don't need to struggle with changing small things in Overleaf. 

3. **Thesis printing and defense planning** will happen after your thesis gets approved by the assessment committee. After that, you may need another half year to finalize the thesis as a book, to design the cover, print the actual thesis, planning and organizing your defense. The whole process could be time-consuming and stressful
    - You can create a timeline including all the steps, deadlines, and contact people if you need help. Here is the one I created for my thesis printing and defense ([Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sgf8_vQGRdbSE7cPoIYW7R0LipQeuxJsU9D3B09CVuA/edit?usp=sharing) or [local xlsx file](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/PhDThesis/blob/main/Defense%20Planning%20Template%20%5BChang%20May%202023%5D.xlsx))
