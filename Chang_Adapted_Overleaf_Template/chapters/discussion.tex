This chapter starts with a review of each chapter in this thesis. Then, we discuss the scientific challenges that are addressed by this thesis when applying theoretical privacy-preserving distributed data mining methods to practical applications. Furthermore, we present the development and potential values of synthetic data followed by a discussion of necessary ethical-legal support in the generation and use of synthetic data in practice. Moreover, we highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations with ethical-legal experts in developing new technologies for privacy and data protection. Finally, we picture a possible future in which citizens take more control over their data access and how their data is processed. We identified what is needed to achieve this future by changing the current centralized data ecosystem to a fully decentralized personal data network.
